For this, you can either create a 'fork' of the repository so that you have a copy that you can manipulate yourself or you can simply clone my repo.

## Linux
git clone https://github.com/TravisMitchell/MECH3750.git

This will clone the repo to your local computer so that you can assess/manipulate the files.

## Windows
For a nice interface to use git, I would recommend downloading:
    https://desktop.github.com

This will allow you to clone the repository and visually see how the process of updating your local repository from remotes will work.
